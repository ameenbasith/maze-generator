# Maze Generator
A Maze Generator utilizing Depth First Search and Graphs to randomly solve numerous mazes inside of a larger square.

## The Problem
"To build a program from scratch that generates and displays square mazes of arbitrary size"

## The Solution


Below video tests program with sizes: 3, 15, 25

0:00 (Size: 3)
0:37 (Size: 15)
1:45 (Size: 25)

As you can see in the video, there are many mazes as the box gets larger. 

This makes sense, since, at lower sizes, there is a much higher probability that all of the mazes will connect with one another, however, at a larger size, the mazes will hardly ever connect.

## What I Learned
This project was one of the first where I was required to create a full code from scratch with very little instruction. 

Although difficult at first, I ultimately took a step back and understood that I had to fully brainstorm my code prior to coding. This actually helped me grow as a programmer, and I am incredibly grateful that I was assigned it.
